# 🏥 LabResults AI: Humanizing Diagnostic Retrieval

This is a project born out of a simple realization: hospital staff are way too busy to be answering "Are my results ready?" calls all day, and patients shouldn't have to navigate robotic, "Press 1 for help" menus. 

I'm bridging the gap between old-school hospital databases and modern AI to make getting your health reports as easy as having a quick chat.

## 🌟 What’s the Big Idea?
Imagine calling your hospital, speaking naturally, and having an AI assistant actually understand you. No keypads, no waiting.
* **Talk to it:** Just say your name or PID.
* **Get the gist:** The AI checks the database and gives you a simple, human summary of your results. 
* **Instant Delivery:** It automatically sends the full PDF to your WhatsApp or Email so you have it immediately. 

## 🛠️ The "Trial & Error" Tech Stack
I haven't locked in the final tools yet because I want to see what works best! I’m currently experimenting with:
* **The Brain:** n8n, Make, or Zapier (to handle the logic and automation). 🧠
* **The Voice:** Twilio, Azure Communication Services (ACS), or BAP (to handle the actual calling). 📞
* **The Memory:** Direct integration with the Hospital Information System (HIS).
